##### **What is Cloud Computing?**

Cloud Computing is a technology that allows you to store and access data and applications over the internet instead of using your computer’s hard drive or a local server.



#### **Architecture Of Cloud Computing**



Cloud computing architecture refers to the components and sub-components required for cloud computing. These components typically refer to:



*Front end ( Fat client, Thin client)*

*Back-end platforms ( Servers, Storage )*

*Cloud-based delivery and a network ( Internet, Intranet, Intercloud )*

<b>1. Front End ( User Interaction Enhancement )</b>

The User Interface of Cloud Computing consists of 2 sections of clients. The Thin clients are the ones that use web browsers facilitating portable and lightweight accessibilities and others are known as Fat Clients that use many functionalities for offering a strong user experience.



**2. Back-end Platforms ( Cloud Computing Engine )**

The core of cloud computing is made at back-end platforms with several servers for storage and processing computing. Management of Applications logic is managed through servers and effective data handling is provided by storage. The combination of these platforms at the backend offers the processing power, and capacity to manage and store data behind the cloud.



**3. Cloud-Based Delivery and Network**

On-demand access to the computer and resources is provided over the Internet, Intranet, and Intercloud. The Internet comes with global accessibility, the Intranet helps in internal communications of the services within the organization and the Intercloud enables interoperability across various cloud services. This dynamic network connectivity ensures an essential component of cloud computing architecture on guaranteeing easy access and data transfer.



**The 5 Core Characteristics of Cloud Computing**

All cloud services share five fundamental characteristics that define them:



On-Demand Self-Service: Users can provision computing resources like servers and storage automatically, without requiring human intervention from the service provider.

Broad Network Access: Capabilities are available over the network and can be accessed through standard mechanisms by any device, such as laptops, tablets, and mobile phones.

Resource Pooling: The provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple customers using a multi-tenant model. Resources are dynamically assigned and reassigned according to demand.

Rapid Elasticity (Scalability): Resources can be scaled up or down quickly and, in some cases, automatically, to meet demand. This ensures you have enough power during traffic spikes and aren't paying for idle resources during quiet periods.

Measured Service (Pay-as-you-go Model): Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use. Usage is monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and the consumer. You only pay for what you use.

The Shared Responsibility Model

Security in the cloud is a partnership between the cloud provider and the customer. This is known as the Shared Responsibility Model.



**The Cloud Provider** (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) is responsible for the security OF the cloud. This includes the physical security of the data centers, the hardware, and the core networking infrastructure.

The Customer (You) is responsible for security IN the cloud. This includes managing who has access to your resources, encrypting your data, configuring firewalls (like Network Policies), and securing your applications.

The amount of responsibility you have depends on the service model you choose.

##### 

##### **Types of Cloud Computing Services**

The following are the types of Cloud Computing:



Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

Platform as a Service (PaaS)

Software as a Service (SaaS)

Function as as Service (FaaS)



### Advantages of Cloud Computing 



1\. Cost Efficiency



No need to buy expensive hardware or maintain servers.

Pay only for what you use (pay-as-you-go model).





2\. Scalability



Easily scale resources up or down based on demand.

Perfect for businesses with fluctuating workloads.





&nbsp;3. Accessibility



Access applications and data from anywhere, on any device with internet.

Great for remote work and global teams.





&nbsp;4. Reliability



Cloud providers offer high availability and disaster recovery.

Data is backed up across multiple servers.





&nbsp;5. Automatic Updates



Software and security updates are handled by the provider.

No manual patching required.





&nbsp;6. Collaboration



Multiple users can work on the same data in real-time.

Tools like Google Docs, Microsoft 365 use this advantage.





&nbsp;7. Security



Advanced security measures like encryption, firewalls, and compliance standards.

Better than most on-premises setups.



#### On-Premise Deployment VS Cloud Deployment 



##### On-Premise Deployment



**Definition**: Applications and data are hosted on servers physically located within the organization.

**Ownership**: Organization owns and manages hardware, software, and infrastructure.

**Cost:** High upfront cost for hardware, licenses, and maintenance.

**Maintenance:** IT team handles updates, security, and backups.

**Scalability:** Limited; requires purchasing and installing new hardware.

**Accessibility:** Usually restricted to internal network or VPN.

**Security:** Full control over data security, but responsibility lies with the organization.

**Disaster Recovery:** Requires dedicated backup systems and planning.





##### Cloud Deployment



**Definition**: Applications and data are hosted on third-party cloud providers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).

**Ownership:** Provider owns infrastructure; organization pays for usage.

**Cost:** Pay-as-you-go model; lower upfront cost.

**Maintenance:** Provider handles updates, patches, and infrastructure.

**Scalability:** Highly scalable; resources can be added or removed instantly.

**Accessibility:** Accessible from anywhere via the internet.

**Security:** Provider offers advanced security, but shared responsibility model.

**Disaster Recovery:** Built-in redundancy and backup options.
