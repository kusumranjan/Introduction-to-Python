Pandas is a powerful Python library for data analysis and manipulation. It is widely used for working with structured data like tables, spreadsheets, and CSV files.







&nbsp;**What is Pandas?**



&nbsp;  Pandas provides two main data structures:

&nbsp;      **Series**: A one-dimensional labeled array (like a column in Excel).

&nbsp;      **DataFrame**: A two-dimensional labeled data structure (like an Excel sheet or SQL table).







&nbsp;**Example 1: Creating a Series**



python

import pandas as pd



&nbsp;Create a Series

s = pd.Series(\[10, 20, 30, 40])

print(s)

```



**Output:**



&nbsp;   0    10

&nbsp;   1    20

&nbsp;   2    30

&nbsp;   3    40

&nbsp;   dtype: int64











**Why Use Pandas?**



\*   Easy to read/write CSV, Excel, SQL.

\*   Powerful data cleaning and transformation tools.

\*   Built-in aggregation, filtering, and grouping.

\*   Works well with NumPy and Matplotlib for analysis and visualization.
